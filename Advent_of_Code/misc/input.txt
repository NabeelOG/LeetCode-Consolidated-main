I shall start the lecture with
0:13
0 minutes 13 seconds
the history of relational model,
0:15
0 minutes 15 seconds
then basic terms or terminologies
0:17
0 minutes 17 seconds
used in relational model and finally
0:20
0 minutes 20 seconds
different keys and it's wrong
0:23
0 minutes 23 seconds
in relational database design.
0:25
0 minutes 25 seconds
Before getting into the
0:27
0 minutes 27 seconds
details of relational model,
0:28
0 minutes 28 seconds
we are going to discuss a brief history
0:31
0 minutes 31 seconds
of relational model relational model or
0:34
0 minutes 34 seconds
record based model was proposed by F God,
13:05
13 minutes 5 seconds
key in the above candidate key.
13:08
13 minutes 8 seconds
We have selected employee
13:09
13 minutes 9 seconds
ID ID as the primary key.
13:12
13 minutes 12 seconds
All other attributes or other
13:14
13 minutes 14 seconds
candidate keys can be selected
13:17
13 minutes 17 seconds
as a as an alternate key.
13:19
13 minutes 19 seconds
So in the above case employee
13:21
13 minutes 21 seconds
ID is the primary key so we can
13:24
13 minutes 24 seconds
select employee name department
13:26
13 minutes 26 seconds
combination as a as an alternate key.
13:31
13 minutes 31 seconds
Here you will learn how to form a
13:34
13 minutes 34 seconds
composite key for a for a relation.
13:37
13 minutes 37 seconds
Sometimes a table may not have a single
13:41
13 minutes 41 seconds
attribute to uniquely identify a temple,
13:44
13 minutes 44 seconds
so it is possible to combine two or more
13:48
13 minutes 48 seconds
attributes to form a database key to
13:51
13 minutes 51 seconds
uniquely identify at Apple in that table.
13:55
13 minutes 55 seconds
Thus, the key formed by combining two or
13:58
13 minutes 58 seconds
more attributes is called a composite key.
14:03
14 minutes 3 seconds
Next, a foreign key.
14:06
14 minutes 6 seconds
The primary key of 1 table may be used
14:09
14 minutes 9 seconds
as a non key attribute of another table.
14:13
14 minutes 13 seconds
Such attribute is referred
14:15
14 minutes 15 seconds
to as a foreign key.
14:17
14 minutes 17 seconds
The main role of foreign key is to specify
14:20
14 minutes 20 seconds
the relationship between two tables.
14:24
14 minutes 24 seconds
Here you can see two tables or two
14:29
14 minutes 29 seconds
relations employee and department
14:32
14 minutes 32 seconds
and the employee relation.
14:33
14 minutes 33 seconds
The department ID is a non key
14:36
14 minutes 36 seconds
attribute or it is a non unique key.
14:39
14 minutes 39 seconds
And this department ID so this
14:42
14 minutes 42 seconds
department ID is the primary
14:44
14 minutes 44 seconds
key of the department relation.
14:47
14 minutes 47 seconds
So the department ID is the foreign is the
14:50
14 minutes 50 seconds
primary key of the department relation,
14:53
14 minutes 53 seconds
and it is the foreign key
14:56
14 minutes 56 seconds
of the employee relation.
14:58
14 minutes 58 seconds
In this lecture we have covered
15:00
15 minutes
the history of relational model.
15:02
15 minutes 2 seconds
The basic terminologies used
15:04
15 minutes 4 seconds
in relational databases,
15:06
15 minutes 6 seconds
relational database design and
15:08
15 minutes 8 seconds
different keys like Super Key,
15:10
15 minutes 10 seconds
candidate key,
15:11
15 minutes 11 seconds
primary key,
15:12
15 minutes 12 seconds
foreign key and composite key and
15:15
15 minutes 15 seconds
their role in relational database design.
